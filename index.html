<h1>Mac Jacobs Homework 6: Census data choropleth </h1>
<a href="./Natural Break Ratio of Employment.png"<h2>Map using Natural Breaks Classification</h2>></a>

The ratio used for this map was found by dividing each set of values for the range by the total number of people in the state.  I thought this would be helpful for people to see the ratio of people in each county rather than the number so they could better understand what these numbers mean compared to the whole state.  The pros of the natural breaks classification is that it actually identifies real classes in the data.  A con is that it does not do well with data that has low variance.
